# Producer-Consumer Problem

Also called **bounded-buffer problem** (because buffer has limited size)

- Producer(생산자) 
- Consumer(소비자)
- Buffer(버퍼): data created by producer is stored in buffer.

### Problems
1. Producer is too fast: buffer is full, need to wait for space.
2. Consumer is too fast: need to wait for new data
