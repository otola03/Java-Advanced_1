#### Why Java?


---

During the first year in the university, I had CS classes of: CSE114(Intro to OOP) and CSE214(Data Structures). 

Java was used in both of the classes. Before joining the army, I learned other languages as well, to broaden my skills, such as Python and
Node.js through personal projets. However, I thought it would be great to get back on Java and be more confident and skillful in it. This was because I didn't feel like I was actually going deep enough in one language.
